## A custom macro pad made with a Raspberry Pi Pico 

### About:

For this project, I have made a custom macro pad for your computer to execute keyboard shortcuts. You can do things from controlling music to opening apps. To do this I used a Raspberry Pi Pico to control the whole thing. To program It I used a version of python for microcontrollers circuit python. I have also made a custom PCB and used CAD to make a case for it. 

If you would like to make one for your self I have added design files in this repo. Found [here](https://github.com/AndrewSae/Pi-Pico-Macro-Pad/tree/main/design%20files)

### Features: 
- Custom key binds
- Rotary encoder to controller the computer's volume
